This place is meant to give you a window into my head. And—well—to give *me* a window into it too. Apart from brain surgery, there are precious few alternatives.

Truthfully, this is the first in many experiments of mine to [Learn in Public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE94ZZo6IVw). I post my efforts here in the hope that one just might wish to remedy my wrongs, giving me a chance to do better next time. Really, I would appreciate it.

And wouldn't it be great if we both ended up learning something along the way?
