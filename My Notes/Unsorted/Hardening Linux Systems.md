# Hardening Linux Systems
Just because one runs a Linux desktop doesn't make them any more secure. I've noticed that certain online communities have spread a myth in the last ~10-20 year. Linux systems—in the eyes of many casual users and enthusiasts—have been assumed to be *inherently secure*. This belief is typically justified by the inclusion of privacy-friendly and secure defaults (AppArmor, SELinux, etc.), as well as the small desktop market share of GNU + Linux. And it leads users to the false conclusion that they need not worry about antivirus software and similar protective measures on their Linux devices. The landscape is changing. Linux desktop adoption has steadily grown over time, and many users are blind to the potential risk of using a system with no built-in contingencies.
